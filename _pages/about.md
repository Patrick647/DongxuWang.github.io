I am a clinical pharmacist currently working at Wuxi Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital. I hold a Master’s degree in Clinical Pharmacology from King’s College London and a Bachelor of Pharmacy from China Pharmaceutical University. My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical trial management.

During my time at the hospital, I have been responsible for therapeutic drug monitoring and have participated in multiple pharmacogenomic clinical intervention trials. Additionally, I serve as the Secretary of the Pharmaceutical Policy Professional Committee of the Wuxi Pharmacists Association, where I coordinate drug policy meetings and compile policy recommendations from pharmacy experts for submission to government health departments.

My professional goal is to enhance patient outcomes through cutting-edge research, proactive policy advocacy, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. In recent years, I have contributed to several key projects, including the development of a high-sensitivity biosensor for early breast cancer diagnosis, research on tailored folic acid supplementation strategies for pregnant women, and the exploration of genetic polymorphism markers for predicting osteoporosis in breast cancer patients. These experiences have not only deepened my expertise in clinical research but also earned me multiple awards and patents.
